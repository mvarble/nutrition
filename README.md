# Nutrition Server

This is my first implementation of a Rust project: a web service that mimics the REST API of [FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/index.html).
The purpose of this project is for me to get acquainted with the Rust programming language and to produce a full-stack application with which I may log my diet.
The UI is implemented in my beloved javascript.
