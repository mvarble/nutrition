# Nutrition Server

This is my first implementation of a Rust project: a simple implementation of a web service that maps [Nutritionix](https://trackapi.nutritionix.com/docs/) requests to a persistent Postgres layer and re-routes the payloads to my own API.
The purpose of this project is for me to get acquainted with the Rust programming language and to produce a full-stack application with which I may log my diet.
